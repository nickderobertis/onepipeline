# npm distribution

`onepipeline-cli` on npm is a **launcher** that carries no binary: the prebuilt
binary ships in a per-platform package (`onepipeline-cli-<platform>-<arch>`)
that npm selects by `os`/`cpu`, and `bin/onepipeline.js` resolves it and execs
it with the caller's argv.

Four places name that platform matrix and must move together:

1. `bin/onepipeline.js`'s `PACKAGES` map,
2. `package.json`'s `optionalDependencies`,
3. `scripts/npm-build.mjs`'s `TARGETS` table,
4. the `build-npm` matrix in `.github/workflows/release.yml`.

The committed `package.json` carries `0.0.0-managed`, not a real version. The
version has exactly one source — `Cargo.toml`, written by release-plz — and
`scripts/npm-build.mjs` stamps it into the launcher and every platform pin at
publish time. Never hand-edit a version here.

Nothing in this directory is published from a developer's machine:
`.github/workflows/release.yml` assembles, packs, and publishes it, and
`scripts/publish-npm.sh` makes that publish idempotent.
