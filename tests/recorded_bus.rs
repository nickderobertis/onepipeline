//! Byte-for-byte fidelity, proven rather than asserted: a stream each of the
//! three producers wrote on a real host round-trips through this crate's
//! `Reader` and `serde_json::to_string` with no byte changed. Those three are
//! [`RECORDED`].
//!
//! A fourth file is deliberately **not** one of them. `onepipeline-relayed-drift.jsonl`
//! holds three relayed lines an older `onepipeline` wrote with `member` among
//! the extras, after `persona`, because its own copy of `Labels` had no field
//! for it. That order is drift this crate reconciled rather than a shape to
//! preserve, so the last test here holds those lines to reading whole and coming
//! back out in the reserved order — which is different bytes, on purpose. They
//! are kept in their own file so the byte-identity tests above stay exact rather
//! than carrying an exception list.
//!
//! All four streams and this test came from `onemessagebus`'s agent profile
//! crate at tag `onemessagebus-agent-v0.8.0`, along with the vocabulary they are
//! written in. That is exactly what makes them worth keeping: the vocabulary
//! moved into `src/vocabulary.rs` and the bytes on the wire did not, and these
//! are the lines that say so. `tests/recorded/bus/README.md` says where each
//! came from.
