//! The gate's coverage step, driven with the artifact that turned it red.
//!
//! `just check` merges one `.profraw` per process the suite ran, and this suite
//! kills instrumented processes on purpose: the cancellation journeys in
//! `tests/e2e/` tear down the `onepipeline` binary and the sibling doubles it
//! started, and a job's own cleanup reaps whatever outlived a test. A child
//! killed while the profiling runtime is still flushing leaves a *truncated*
//! profile behind, and `llvm-profdata merge` defaults to rejecting the entire
//! merge over a single one of those. That is how CI run 32721690155's `gate`
//! job died with 809 of 809 tests green:
//!
//! ```text
//! warning: .../onepipeline-46576-18438271468876688950_0.profraw: invalid
//!          instrumentation profile data (file header is corrupt)
//! error: no profile can be merged
//! ```
//!
//! which `_crate-test` then reported as `tests failed, or coverage fell below
//! 95%` — a message about the suite, for a suite that had passed.
//!
//! So this plants exactly that artifact, on every coverage run, in the directory
//! the recipe merges from — and the recipe is the assertion. `just check` has to
//! merge the surviving profiles, report over them, and still enforce
//! `--fail-under-lines`. Take `--failure-mode all` back out of the justfile and
//! the recipe fails again, which is the regression this exists to hold.
