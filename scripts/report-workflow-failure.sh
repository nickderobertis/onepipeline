# Announce a failed workflow run as a GitHub issue.
#
# A `workflow_run` leg has no pull request to turn red and nobody waiting on it,
# so a failure that announces itself nowhere is one nobody reads — which is the
# same as not running the check at all. This gives it somewhere to be seen.
#
# One open issue, commented on each further failure, so a bad week at a registry
# is one thread rather than one issue per release. A file rather than inline
# workflow YAML because the create-vs-comment branch is real behavior:
# `npm/test/failure-report.test.mjs` drives both halves against a stubbed `gh`.
#
# Every refusal below says what broke AND what to do about it, for the same
# reason the script exists: it runs only when something is already wrong, so a
# reporter that dies quietly takes the finding down with it.
#
# Reads (all required except RUN_URL):
#   REPO      owner/name to file against
#   TITLE     the issue title, which is also how an existing one is found
#   BODY      the issue or comment body
#   RUN_URL   appended to the body when set
# `gh` must be authenticated — GH_TOKEN in CI.
