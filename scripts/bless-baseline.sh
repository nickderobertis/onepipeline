# Refresh THIS host's committed screencomp baseline from the capture in
# `shots/current` — the one place that decides which lane is rewritten and where.
#
# Shared by `just screenshots-bless` (an intended output change) and the pre-push
# guard's drift path (.githooks/pre-push), so the two can never disagree about
# the lane or the manifest path. `$SHOTS_CURRENT` overrides the capture root.

# llmlint: ignore-file[new_code_lands_in_a_project] the visual-docs capture is
# informational machinery outside every Nx target the gate reaches, and outside
# the crate on purpose (the 95% coverage floor is measured over the crate).
