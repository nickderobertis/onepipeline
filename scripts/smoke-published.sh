#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Smoke-test an `onepipeline` that is already on PATH, and name the install
# that broke when it does not behave.
#
# One script, one set of assertions. `release.yml`'s verify jobs and
# `published-smoke.yml` run this over a binary they installed from PyPI or npm;
# CI's `install` job runs the identical file over the binary this repo just
# compiled. That is what stops a workflow's idea of "it works" from drifting from
# what actually ships — assertions inlined in a workflow keep passing after the
# surface around them changes.
#
# Deliberately toolchain-free: bash and the installed binary. The scheduled sweep
# runs this every week on every OS, for both registries, and anything it had to
# install first would be a second thing that can rot.
#
# While the crate is interface-only, the promise a published artifact makes is
# its *surface*: it reports its version, prints the documented command list, and
# refuses to pretend it ran a graph. Extend the assertions here as behavior
# lands — this file is what a release proves.
